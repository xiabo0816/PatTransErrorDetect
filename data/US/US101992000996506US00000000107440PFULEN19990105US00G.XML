    <base:Paragraphs>This invention relates to a new and distinct apple tree rootstock clone that originated as a mutation of Malling 9 (M9). Standard growing apple cultivars propagated on this new rootstock are approximately 65% of the size of like apple trees growing on apple seedling rootstocks. Compared to its M9 parent, this new clone produces many more and larger lateral branches, has leaves with acute tips and has more sinuate serrations. The clone is also more vigorous and produces a larger number of rooted plants in a given area of stoolbed.</base:Paragraphs>

    <business:TechnicalField>
      <base:Paragraphs>BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</base:Paragraphs>
      <base:Paragraphs>The inventor of the subject variety, Rene Nicolai, was the owner of Rene Nicolai Nursery, which propagated and sold Malling Nine (M9) apple tree root stock. Root stock are propagated by placing plants in a stool bed which encourages root growth and then dividing the resulting roots into individual plants. Over the years Mr. Nicolai searched the M9 stool beds for M9 mutants which were superior to the parent variety in those characteristics which are desirable for apple tree root stock.</base:Paragraphs>
      <base:Paragraphs>The subject clone was selected in 1967 from a large stool bed of M9 plants that was planted in 1960 at the Rene Nicolai Nursery at Linderstoot, 22-B-3820 Alken, Belgium. The original source of the plants in the bed was the East Malling Research Station in England. Following its selection, the clone was assigned a number (RN19) and was propagated for further testing and evaluation.</base:Paragraphs>
      <base:Paragraphs>Since all original M9 root stocks have been found to be virus infected, the RN19 plants were subsequently heat treated by application of dry heat, in order to obtain virus-free testing, the new root stock cone was again exposed to multiplication techniques (stooling) followed by continued testing and evaluation.</base:Paragraphs>
      <base:Paragraphs>Virus-free RN19 progeny plants were expanded into small stool bed plantings at several locations which were planted separately in order to examine the new variety's individual characteristics in small semi- commercial stool bed sites.  Since 1974 nearly 40,000 plants of the subject variety have been planted at the following six sites and, in the process, may generations of the tree have been produced.</base:Paragraphs>
      <base:Paragraphs>1. A site at Deveaux, Belgium was planted in the spring of 1974 with 1, 500 plants of the subject clone.</base:Paragraphs>
      <base:Paragraphs>2. A site at Bordeaux, France was planted in 1977 with 200 plants of the subject clone.</base:Paragraphs>
      <base:Paragraphs>3. A site at Wissenhoeve, Belgium was planted in the spring of 1980 with 2,058 plants of the subject clone.</base:Paragraphs>
      <base:Paragraphs>4. A site near St. Truiden, Belgium was planted in the spring of 1982 with 100 plants of the subject clone. 5. A site at Henkaenrts, Belgium was planted in the spring of 1986 with 3,250 plants of the subject clone. </base:Paragraphs>
      <base:Paragraphs>6. A site at Ephrata, Wash. was planted in the spring of 1990 with 2, 000 plants of the subject clone.</base:Paragraphs>
      <base:Paragraphs>Clone RN19 was subsequently finally selected as a rootstock clone that continues to possess growth and rooting characteristics that are distinctly different from its M9 parent.</base:Paragraphs>
      <base:Paragraphs>It distinguished itself in these beds from its M9 parent in the following ways:</base:Paragraphs>
      <base:Paragraphs>1. The subject clone produces many more lateral limbs (feathers or spurs) than its M9 parent and grows more robustly in the stoolbed (FIGS. 1 and 2; Charts 1 and 2). The average increase in height of daughter plants growing in the stoolbed is approximately 20% (FIG. 6, M 9; and FIG. 7, RN19) and the average increase in the number of feathers produced is approximately three-fold at Bordeaux, France and almost six- fold at Ephrata, Wash. (Charts 1 and 2). A significant difference in the average length of the individual feathers produced is also noted (Chart 2) .  Because of RN19's more robust growth and its characteristic habit of producing more and larger feathers, an increased difference in the average number of leaves produced per daughter plant also occurs (Chart 2) . A slight increases difference in the average number of nodes per shoot and in the average stem circumference is also noted (Chart 2). RN19 exhibits a much lesser early bloom characteristic than does its M 9 parent (Chart 3).  Leaf size (adding the length and width together) and the length of the leaf particles are consistently smaller than the virus- free M 9 (Chart 4).</base:Paragraphs>

The subject clone has the ability to produce many more rooted daughter plants per mother plant and per meter of stoolbed row than its M 9 parent (FIGS. 4 and 5; Charts 5, 6 and 7). Data collected at the Bordeaux test site in France shows an approximately three-fold increase in the number of daughter plants produced over a four-year period and data collected at the Deveaux test site in Belgium shows an approximately two-fold increase over six- and nine-year periods.</base:Paragraphs>

      <base:Paragraphs>Size control potential: Size of trees budded on the subject rootstocks will vary according to the vigor of the cultivar and/or type of soil and orchard management. &amp;quot;Standard&amp;quot; growing cultivars such as Red and Golden Delicious are reduced in size about 65% when compared to trees on apple seedling rootstocks.  Less vigorous varieties are more reduced in size and more vigorous varieties are less reduced in size.</base:Paragraphs>
      <base:Paragraphs>Dwarfing: Fully dwarfing.</base:Paragraphs>

      <base:Paragraphs>Root anchorage: Needs support.</base:Paragraphs>

  <business:Claims dataFormat="original" sourceDB="US" lang="en">
    <base:Paragraphs>What is claimed is:</base:Paragraphs>
    <base:Paragraphs>1. A new and distinct apple tree clone, a sport of the Malling 9, referred to by the cultivar designation `M9-RN19`, substantially as herein shown and described, characterized particularly by its stability to serve as a rootstock for grafting of apple tree cultivars to produce dwarf apple trees and by its ability to root very readily in the stoolbed with very little lateral branching and produce high quality stoolbed rootstock plants for nursery use.</base:Paragraphs>
